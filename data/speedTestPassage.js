  "Have you ever been to the world's smallest bookstore? The World's Smallest Bookstore, whose official name is just these three words, sits quietly about 100 miles northeast of Toronto. The bookstore is about 10 feet by 10 feet, so it is easy to imagine how tiny it really is. The bookstore is open 24 hours a day. Inside the bookstore are various books, especially literary books and classic authors' works. So if you are looking for something less popular, you may get a bit disappointed there. Another special feature of this bookstore is that each book only costs three dollars. All the expenses are paid on the honor system, which means buyers should make a note of what they've bought and leave their money by themselves. So the tools of the trade in this bookstore are quite simple: pens, papers, light bulbs and a label-maker. In order to catch passers-by's attention, the billboards of the bookstore are several times bigger than the store itself. With these large eye-catchers, many people are willing to stop by and have a visit.";
